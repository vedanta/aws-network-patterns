## 1. Hub and Spoke Pattern

**Architecture:**
- Central hub VPC
- Multiple spoke VPCs
- Transit Gateway routing

**Benefits:**
- Centralized management
- Simplified routing
- Cost-effective
- Enhanced security

```mermaid

    TG[Transit Gateway]
    HUB[Hub VPC]
    SP1[Spoke VPC 1]
    SP2[Spoke VPC 2]
    SP3[Spoke VPC 3]
    
    TG --- HUB
    TG --- SP1
    TG --- SP2
    TG --- SP3
```

## 2. Multi-Account Landing Zone

**Architecture:**
- AWS Organizations
- Separate functional accounts
- Shared services

**Benefits:**
- Strong isolation
- Cost tracking
- Compliance control

```mermaid
graph TB
    ORG[AWS Organizations]
    SHARED[Shared Services Account]
    DEV[Development Account]
    TEST[Test Account]
    PROD[Production Account]
    
    ORG --- SHARED
    ORG --- DEV
    ORG --- TEST
    ORG --- PROD
```

## 3. B2C Application Pattern

**Architecture:**
- Multi-AZ design
- 3-tier architecture
- Auto-scaling groups

**Benefits:**
- High availability
- Scalability
- Security in depth

```mermaid
graph TB
    ALB[Application Load Balancer]
    WEB[Web Tier - Public Subnet]
    APP[App Tier - Private Subnet]
    DB[Database - Isolated Subnet]
    
    ALB --> WEB
    WEB --> APP
    APP --> DB
```

## 4. B2B Integration Pattern

**Architecture:**
- Multiple connection types
- Private service access
- API management

**Benefits:**
- Secure partner access
- Service isolation
- Managed connections

```mermaid
graph TB
    DX[Direct Connect]
    VPN[VPN Connection]
    PL[PrivateLink]
    APIG[API Gateway]
    
    DX --- PL
    VPN --- PL
    PL --- APIG
```

## 5. Hybrid Network Pattern

**Architecture:**
- Direct Connect primary
- VPN backup
- DNS integration

**Benefits:**
- High bandwidth
- Low latency
- Redundancy

```mermaid
graph TB
    DC[On-Premises DC]
    DX2[Direct Connect]
    VPN2[Backup VPN]
    VPC[AWS VPC]
    
    DC --- DX2
    DC -.-> VPN2
    DX2 --- VPC
    VPN2 -.-> VPC
```

## 6. Segmented Network Pattern

**Architecture:**
- Isolated compliance VPCs
- Strict access controls
- Limited connectivity

**Benefits:**
- Compliance ready
- Reduced risk
- Clear boundaries

```mermaid
graph TB
    PCI[PCI VPC]
    HIPAA[HIPAA VPC]
    DEV2[Dev VPC]
    TG2[Transit Gateway]
    
    TG2 --- PCI
    TG2 --- HIPAA
    TG2 --- DEV2
```

## 7. Multi-Region Pattern

**Architecture:**
- Multiple regions
- Global routing
- Regional resources

**Benefits:**
- Global resilience
- Lower latency
- Disaster recovery

```mermaid
graph TB
    US[US Region]
    EU[EU Region]
    ASIA[Asia Region]
    GLB[Global Load Balancer]
    
    GLB --> US
    GLB --> EU
    GLB --> ASIA
    US --- EU
    EU --- ASIA
```

## 8. Edge Network Pattern

**Architecture:**
- Central hub VPC
- Edge location VPCs
- Local compute/caching
- Outpost/Local Zones

**Benefits:**
- Low latency for edge
- Local data processing
- Reduced bandwidth
- Better user experience

```mermaid
graph TB
    HQ[Central HQ VPC]
    TG3[Transit Gateway]
    EDGE1[Edge Location 1 - Outpost]
    EDGE2[Edge Location 2 - Local Zone]
    EDGE3[Edge Location 3 - Lightweight VPC]
    
    HQ --- TG3
    TG3 --- EDGE1
    TG3 --- EDGE2
    TG3 --- EDGE3
    
    CF1[CloudFront PoP]
    CF2[CloudFront PoP]
    CF1 -.-> EDGE1
    CF2 -.-> EDGE2
```
